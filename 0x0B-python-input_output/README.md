# Python - Input/Output

## This project is a deep dive into Python's file handling capabilities, including reading and writing files, working with JSON, and understanding serialization and deserialization. Through these tasks, learners can grasp how to manipulate files and use these operations to handle data persistently.

Learning Objectives
File Handling: Learn how to open, read, write, and append to files in Python without the need to worry about closing them, thanks to the with statement.
Serialization: Understand how to convert Python objects to a JSON string for easy storage and sharing.
Deserialization: Learn to take a JSON string and convert it back into a Python data structure.
JSON Operations: Discover how to use Python's built-in JSON support to serialize and deserialize objects, and why this is useful for data storage and APIs.
